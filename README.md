# Hi there 👋, I'm José!


I’m currently working as a Product Data Scientist at Adevinta Marktplaats!

I enjoy using advanced data analytics, statistics, big data, and programming to guide product development. My role involves transforming complex data into actionable recommendations and providing experimentation guidance, helping teams build products that improve the user journey.

I also lecture on a Statistics and Experimentation course on our internal training platform. Here, I help non-technical stakeholders understand how to use experimentation for decision-making, enabling the creation of impactful products.

I am passionate about learning, mentoring people, and honing communication skills.

## ⚡ Fun Fact
- Before venturing into the tech world, I worked for approximately 9 years in scientific research! During this time, I earned a PhD in Neuroscience focused on learning and memory, and moved from Portugal to Bordeaux, France, and eventually to New York City, USA.

## 🛠️ My Technical Skills
- Data Analytics & Big Data
- Statistics & Experimentation
- Product Development
- Programming (Python & Sql) & Technical Tools (Git, Databricks, GCP, Tableau)
